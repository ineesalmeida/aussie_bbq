# Pikachu following the cursor experiment (unfinished)

This was a quick experiment to have a character in the bottom on an html page following the mouse movement horizontally, and then start to jump as if trying to catch the mouse cursor.

The idea was to implement this to make a website to advertise a VR game with a similar (well, a lot more complex) mechanic, but I decided to cut it short.
